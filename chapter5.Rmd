# Chapter 5: Dimensionality reduction techniques

```{r setup5, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
human <- read.csv("data/human.csv")
```

In this chapter I will wrangle and analyse data from UNs Development programs Human Development Index (HDI) and Gender Inequality Index data frames. These are combined together to be a data frame named "Human". More about the data frame here: [UN development programs: HDI](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)

```{r human, echo=FALSE}
str(human)
dim(human)
```


The structure of the frame shows the 19 variables of this frame. The variables with suffix .hd or .gii are related to the frames HDI and GII. F and M indicate genders in variable names and edu education.
